Push_swap

Push_swap is a project designed to implement an efficient sorting algorithm using stacks, as part of the 42Cursus curriculum. This project focuses on algorithmic efficiency and optimization.

Features

- Stack-Based Sorting: Implements a sorting algorithm using two stacks.
- Optimal Moves: Aims for the least number of operations to sort the stack.
- Visualization: Optional visual representation of the sorting process to aid understanding.

Installation

Clone the repository and compile the program:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/schennal/push_swap.git
cd push_swap
make
```

Usage

Run the program with a list of integers to sort:

```bash
./push_swap 3 2 5 1 4
```
